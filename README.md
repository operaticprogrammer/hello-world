# hello-world

This is my first repository as a former opera singer turned aspiring programmer!

Although I have some experience with computers, I only paid as much attention to what happens behind-the-scenes as much as I needed to in order to keep my desktop running smoothly.

With any luck, by this day next year, I will have enough experience, connections, and drive to land a junior developer job in either my area or wherever I end up moving to.
